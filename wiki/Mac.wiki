= Introduction =

I am looking at developing a Mac version.

== Issues ==

There are several things to be done to get this emulator working on any given platform:

 * Learn the gui for the platform, in this case there is a possibility of using Carbon.

 * Find out how to capture user keystrokes. This isn't necessarily as simple as it seems, as we are using the function keys, and the control and alt keys. In windows the F10 key goes somewhere different from the others. The keys may be different on a Mac for all I know.

 * Find out how to stop unwanted keyboard side effects, like alt-spacebar. I have done this in windows.

 * Find out how to send midi events to either a built in midi synthesizer (windows), or a synthesizer on the sound card. I assume the sound hardware is built in on a Mac.

== Progress ==

 * I don't have a Mac. I have made a quick investigation into cross development on windows or linux, but it doesn't look hopeful.
 * I have discovered that it is possible to run hacked versions of Mac OSX on a PC, so I am currently investigation development on a Hackintosh using Carbon.
